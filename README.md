# Dressage
Computer dressage for (toxic)productivity.

# Why
* Zero self control.

# Tools
* [*NextDNS*](https://nextdns.io/)
* [*Timekpr-nExT*](https://mjasnik.gitlab.io/timekpr-next/)
* Gnome parental controls(optional)

# How-To
* Disable USB boot, use a random password to protect your firmware settings.
* Two users, *horse*(normal user), *rider*(wheel), use a VERY LONG passphrase for *rider*.
* Write the passphrases for *NextDNS* and *rider* and wrap them inside a plastic, then duct tape it.

# How it works
* You are the rider, the horses are your genes.
* Lock yourself before yourself get you locked.
